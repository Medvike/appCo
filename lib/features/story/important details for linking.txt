        how it works:
            preface:

                Emoji class is working for a single story that means we need to determine which story is shown now
                Depending on this:

            In detail:
                Emoji class functions contain:
                    1- instance form (StoryTestData) to use its (stories) List and get the reaction of this story and also change it
                    2- an int var for currentStory which is playing to determine the index of the story form (stories) List

                Emoji displayBottom sheet:
                    has the same data of class functions in addition to ( EmojiController )
                    That to be used later to change the (StoryBottomEmojiButton) of storyScreen

                    this bottomSheet used in (StoryBottomEmojiButton) LongPress showing the List of reactions
                    which also using the the (EmojiController) as we said

                A compnation between (StoryTestData) & (EmojiModel)
